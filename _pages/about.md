I'm now working as a Senior Engineer at CLP Power. I am responsible to lead cross-functional teams to establish power substations, ensuring the electricity supply to Kowloon and New Territories areas.
With an eye towards the future, my goal is to assume a management-level position within the company, where I can leverage my expertise to shape the company's long-term strategy and direction.
